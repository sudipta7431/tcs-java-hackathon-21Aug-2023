Create a class Income TaxFiling with the below attributes:

panNo - int
name - String
taxToBePaid - int
taxPaid - int
location - String

The above attributes should be private, write getters, setters and parameterized constructor as required.
Create class MyClass with main method.

Implement two static methods - find Balance TaxToBePaid and findMaxTaxPaid in MyClass class.
findBalance TaxToBePaid method:
This method will take two input parameters - array of Income TaxFiling objects and an int parameter.
The method will return the balance tax amount to be paid for the given PAN No(int parameter passed) from array of Income TaxFiling objects.
The balance tax can be calculated by using the given formula.
Balance Tax = Tax to be Paid - Tax Paid
If no Income TaxFiling with the above condition is present in the array of Income TaxFiling objects, then the method should return 0.
findMaxTaxPaid method:
This method will take two input parameters - array of Income TaxFiling object and a String parameter.
The method will return the maximum tax amount paid from array of Income TaxFiling objects for the given location(String parameter passed).
If no Income TaxFiling object with the given condition is present in the array of
Income TaxFiling objects, then the method return 0.
Note: No two Income TaxFiling object would have the same panNo.
All the searches should be case sensitive.
The above mentioned static method should be called from the main method.
For findBalanceTaxToBePaid method - The main method should print the returned balance as it is, if the returned value is greater than 0, or it
should print "No such PAN No".
For findMaxTaxPaid method - The main method should print the returned maximum tax paid as it is, if the returned value is greater than 0, or it
should print "No such incometax filing".
Before calling these static methods in main, use Scanner object to read the values of four Income TaxFiling objects referring attributes in the above mentioned attribute sequence.
Next, read one int value and one String value for capturing pan No and location.
