Create a class Satellite with below attributes:
satelliteld - int
satelliteName - String
country - String
boostersCountUsed - int
purpose- String
expense - int(in crores)
The above attributes should be private, write getters, setters and parameterized constructor as required.
Create class MyClass with main method.
Implement two static methods - getSatelliteWithHighestExpense and getSatelliteBasedOnGivenCountry in Solution class.
getSatelliteWithHighestExpense method:
The method will take an array of Satellite Objects and a String value as input parameters and will return the Satellite with the highest expenses from array of Satellite objects
for the given purpose (String parameter passed). If no Satellite with the given Satellite purpose is present in the array of Satellite objects, then the method should return null.
getSatelliteBasedOnGivenCountry method:
This method will take three input parameters - array of Satellite objects and one int parameter and one String parameter.
This method will return the Satellite ID from the array of Satellite objects for the given country only if the booster count used is greater than the given booster
counts. If no Satellite with the above condition is present in the array of Satellite objects, then the method should return 0.
Note: No two Satellite will have the same satelliteld.
All the searches should be case insensitive.
The above mentioned static methods should be called from the main method. For getSatelliteWithHighestExpense method - The main method should print the satelliteld,satellite Name and country from the returned Satellite object if the returned value is not null
otherwise it should print "No such Satellite". Pleass refer the sample output for more details.
-
For getSatelliteBased OnGiven Country method - The main method should print the returned satelliteld as it is if the returned value is not greater than 0. Else it should print "No such type".
Before calling these static methods in main, use Scanner object to read the values of four Satellite objects referring attributes in the above mentioned
attribute sequence.
Next, read the value of one String parameter, one int parameter and one more String parameter for capturing purpose, boosters Count Used and country respectively.
